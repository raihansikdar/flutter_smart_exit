name: flutter_smart_exit
description: "A lightweight, fully-customizable Flutter widget that intercepts the Android back button and provides multiple elegant exit options. With a single wrapper widget, you can prevent accidental app exits and give users a polished “double-back to exit” experience—or show a bottom sheet, popup dialog, or snack bar before closing the app."
